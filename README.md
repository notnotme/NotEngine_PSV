# NotEngine_PSV
A little framework for the ps vita to render graphics and audio (not yet audio) on PSVITA.

For now it is still in early stage of developpement, and the changes between each commit can
change a lot of things.

Install:
 - First install glm (http://glm.g-truc.net/) into your vitasdk toolchain
 - Enter into the NotEngine project directory type "make -f Makefile.psp2 && make -f Makefile.psp2 install"
 - You're up to go

TODO:
 - Make SpriteSheet & json loading (see here: http://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sstool/)
 - Add animation to sprite
 - Emulate basic immediate rendering (like opengl 1.2 days)
