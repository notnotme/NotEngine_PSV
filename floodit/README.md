# Floodit
A little homebrew game for the PSVITA where you have to fill a grid of color.


TODO:
 - Add sound when user click something


Compile:
 - First install NotEngine_PSV
 - Enter into the floodit project directory type "make -f Makefile.psp2"
 - Now you should have floodit.velf in the root folder

 - Leency for the floodit game for kolibrios (http://kolibrios.org/). I used his color scheme :)


All icons comes from the Google Material Design Icons (https://github.com/google/material-design-icons)
The font used is Droid Sans.
The other GFX was made with GIMP.
